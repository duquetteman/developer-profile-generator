# Developer Profile Generator

A command-line application that dynamically generates a PDF profile from a GitHub username. The application can be invoked with the following command:

node index.js

## Instructions
Clone the repo to a local directory, open in terminal, run npm install, then run node index.js to start the application. The genereated pdf will be placed in the root directory.

## Business Context

When preparing a report for stakeholders, it is important to have up-to-date information about members of the development team. Rather than navigating to each team member's GitHub profile, a command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of profiles in PDF format.


```
Given the developer has a GitHub profile, when prompted for the developer's GitHub username and favorite color, a PDF profile is generated.
